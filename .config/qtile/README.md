# ~/.config/qtile
qtile version: v0.17.1

I found that several features are hard to configure:
* Not compatible with wechat image preview windows.
* No titlebar, which makes mouse dragging to move windows cross screens super hard
* Can't come up with a workaround to move windows cross monitors or just maximize/minimize the window with mouse

Therefore, I won't actively maintain this configuration for some time.
